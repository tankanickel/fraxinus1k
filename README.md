# Fraxinus 1k (Custom Mod Version)

This slicer and printer configurations are for a Kingroon KP3S printer, that has been modded into a Fraxinus 1k with some mods here and there.

Requirements: (non stock KP3S parts)
- Orbiter 2.0
- Activation of UART on all Stepper drivers
- V6 Hotend
- BL Touch / 3D Touch
- EBB36 v1.2 Can Toolhead (I currently use 4 pins of the endstop connection + 1 of the dupont probe points (ground) for the 3d Touch)

The slicer configuration is still a work in progress and subject to change at any time!

It's quite a nice build and looks awesome (and works really well).
Note: It's currently in a beta phase, so it might take a while until the BOM and the build documents are released to the public.
The non-standard hotend and cable parts will be uploaded here in a STL folder later on.
